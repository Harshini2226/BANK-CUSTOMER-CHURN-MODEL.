# BANK-CUSTOMER-CHURN-MODEL.
This project predicts the likelihood of bank customers churning (i.e., leaving the bank). By using machine learning, the model identifies patterns in customer data that indicate potential churn. This helps the bank implement proactive retention strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing attrition.

# Project Overview
The Bank Customer Churn Prediction Model is a machine learning project developed to identify customers likely to churn. It uses historical customer data to train a predictive model, which then classifies customers based on their churn probability.

# Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
Feature Engineering: Extracts behavioral and demographic features that are likely to influence churn.
Modeling and Evaluation: Trains and evaluates various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to find the best predictive model.
Deployment: Provides churn predictions for customer records and can be integrated into production for real-time insights.
# Dataset
The dataset includes anonymized bank customer information, with columns such as:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Balance: Account balance.
Tenure: Duration of customerâ€™s relationship with the bank.
NumOfProducts: Number of products held by the customer.
IsActiveMember: Indicates if the customer is an active user.
EstimatedSalary: Estimated yearly salary.
Exited: Target column, indicating whether the customer churned (1) or not (0).
Note: Modify this dataset section based on the actual columns in your data.
